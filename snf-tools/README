Example scripts
-----------------
Under /snf-tools/conf/ you can find example scripts for automating snf-burnin testing using cron.

- **snf-burnin-run.sh** runs snf-burnin with the given parameters, deletes stale instances (servers, networks) from old runs and delete logs older than a week. It aborts if snf-burnin runs for longer than expected. 
- **snf-burnin-output.sh** checks for failed snf-burnin tests the last 30 minutes in a given log folder. Exit status is 0 if no failures where encountered, else exit status is 1.
