==========
Log files
==========

In each run, snf-burnin stores log files in the folder defined in the --log-folder parameter (default is /var/log/burnin) under the folder with the timestamp of the snf-burnin-run and the image used for it. The name prefixes of the log files are:

- details: Showing the complete log of snf-burnin run.
- error: Showing the testcases that encountered a runtime error.
- failed: Showing the testcases that encountered a failure.


Example scripts
-----------------
Under /snf-tools/conf/ you can find example scripts for automating snf-burnin testing using cron.

- **snf-burnin-run.sh** runs snf-burnin with the given parameters, deletes stale instances (servers, networks) from old runs and delete logs older than a week. It aborts if snf-burnin runs for longer than expected. 
  
  - **Usage**: ./snf-burnin-run.sh TOKEN IMAGE-ID LOG_FOLDER

- **snf-burnin-output.sh** checks for failed snf-burnin tests the last 30 minutes in a given log folder. Exit status is 0 if no failures where encountered, else exit status is 1.
  
  - **Usage**: ./snf-burnin-output.sh LOG_FOLDER
