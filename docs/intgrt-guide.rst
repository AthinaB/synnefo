Synnefo Integrator's Guide
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This is the complete Synnefo Integrator's Guide

Developer's quick start
=======================

This section describes how to setup quickly a synnefo development environment.
The setup uses ``pip`` and ``virtualenv`` and we assume you do it on a working
debian system. The purpose of this section is to provide the synnefo developer
with a quick installation, so that he can have all the synnefo components
up and running to start developing.
