.. _Changelog:

Unified Changelog file for Synnefo versions >= 0.13
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Since v0.13 most of the Synnefo components have been merged into a single
repository and have aligned versions.

v0.14next
=========

Released: UNRELEASED

Synnefo-wide
------------

* Integrate Pithos tests in continuous integration.

Astakos
-------

* Changes in project schema:

  * A Project entry is created when submitting an application for a new
    project, rather than on approval. Its state is dependent on the state
    of its `reference' application (current definition). Lock Project rather
    than Chain (the latter is semantically obsolete).

  * Project states "Active - Pending" and "Suspended - Pending" have been
    removed. In management command `project-list', the existence of a pending
    modification is indicated by a non-blank `Pending AppID'.

  * Improve recording of project, application, and membership actions.

* Implement API calls for projects.

* Store the base URL of a component. Deployer should provide it when adding
  a new component. Service endpoints originating from a component are
  expected to match its base URL; otherwise, a warning is issued.
  Re-registration with `snf-component-register' affects both the base and
  the ui URL.

* Management commands:
  * Introduced new commands:
     * component-show
  * Changed commands:
     * component-add got options --base-url and --ui-url

Cyclades
--------

* Implement Floating IP addresses, which are addresses that can be dynamically
  added and removed to a running server.

  * Implement the 'os-floating-ips' and 'os-floating-ip-pools' API extensions.
  * Implement 'snf-manage floating-ip-list' management command.
  * Add 'floating_ip_pool' attribute to networks. Such networks must exist to
    all Ganeti backends.

* Speed up server reconciliation, by performing parallel reconciliation for
  each backend.
* Implement IPv6 only networks.
* Implement 'resize' server action.

  * Implement the 'resize' server action, to change the flavor of a server.
  Only 'cpu' and 'memory' resizing is supported.

* Compute quotas for CPU and memory of running vms.
* Obsolete PUBLIC_USE_POOL setting, since Cyclades manages IP pool for all
  type of networks.
* Extend servers info API response with 'SNF:fqdn' attribute, and introduce
  CYCLADES_SERVERS_FQDN to set the template for servers FDQN.
* Extend servers info API response with 'SNF:port_forwarding' attribute,
  describing port fowarding rules (DNAT) that are applied to vms. The
  description of such rules is done via the new CYCLADES_PORT_FORWARDING
  setting.
* Change --dhcp option of network management commands from a flag to a boolean
  value, e.g. --dhcp=True
* Remove 'ARCHIPELAGO_BACKENDS' setting used to distinquish between backends
  that hosted only archipelago backends. Instead allocation is based on which
  disk-templates are enabled in each backend.
* Implement 'snf-manage server-remove' management command.
* Move reconciliation of IP pools from 'reconcile-networks' to
  'reconcile-pools'. The IP pool reconciliation does not reconcile the IP
  pools with Ganeti. Instead it checks if the pool is consistent with the
  IPs that are used by instances.
* Do not automatically release externally reserved IPs if they are released
  from a Ganeti backend. Management of externally reserved IPs must be
  performed from Cyclades with 'network-modify' command.

Pithos
------

* Refactor metadata schema (table attributes) in Pithos DB to speedup current
objects by domain attribute. This is used by Plankton for listing VM images.

* Enforce container-level atomicity in (most) Pithos API calls.

v0.14
=====

Released: Tue Jun 25 14:01:19 EEST 2013

Synnefo-wide
------------

* Create 'snf_django' Python package to hold common code for all Synnefo
  components.

* Create a JSON-exportable definition document for each Synnefo Components
  (Astakos, Cyclades, Pithos, etc.) that consolidates APIs (services),
  resources, and other standardized properties (e.g. default URL prefixes).

* Standardize URLs for Synnefo Components, impose structure and naming
  conventions to related settings. Make each component deployable under
  a user-configurable <COMPONENT>_BASE_URL. Each API (compute, image, etc.)
  is deployable under a developer-configurable prefix beneath BASE_URL.

* Deprecate CLOUDBAR_ACTIVE_SERVICE setting from all apps. 

* Common synnefo 404/500 templates (located in snf-webproject)

Astakos
-------

* Redesign of the accounting system (quotaholder) and integration into
  Astakos.

  * Simplified the quotaholder model; removed tables Entity and Policy; now
    table Holding contains limit and usage for every holding.
  * Extended table Holding, so that we can keep track of quota for every
    valid combination of holder (e.g. user), resource, and source (e.g. the
    default system or some specific project).
  * Refactored code for issuing and resolving commissions for robustness;
    added a 'force' option to bypass the upper limit check when issuing a
    commission.
  * Simplified syncing to the quotaholder; removed fields from models
    Project and ProjectMembership, previously needed for syncing; removed
    state PROJECT_DEACTIVATED from ProjectMembership.
  * Removed settings ASTAKOS_QUOTAHOLDER_URL, ASTAKOS_QUOTAHOLDER_TOKEN,
    and ASTAKOS_QUOTAHOLDER_POOLSIZE.

* API-related changes:

  * Implemented API calls for quota, resources, and commissions.
  * Moved all API calls under '/account/v1.0'.
  * Implemented the keystone API call POST /tokens under '/identity/v2.0'.

* Service and resource specification and handling:

  * Specified a format for defining services along with the API endpoints
    and the resources they expose. Migrated internal resource name by
    prefixing it with service name (e.g. 'vm' becomes 'cyclades.vm');
    renamed registered service 'pithos+' to 'pithos'.
  * Specified a procedure to register a Synnefo component, its services and
    their resources in astakos and set the resources' default base quota
    limit. Removed resource definitions from settings.
  * Moved service and resource presentation data out of the respective db
    models into a separate file of UI constants.

* Converted the limit on pending applications from a setting to a quotable
  resource. Converted the related user setting to a user-specific base quota
  limit. Deprecated model UserSetting; removed setting
  ASTAKOS_PENDING_APPLICATION_LIMIT.

* Changes in locking strategy:

  * Lock only project's chain for all project operations; lock user before
    syncing to quotaholder.
  * When locking multiple rows (e.g. users or holdings) include an ORDER BY
    clause in the query to impose ordering on locking.

* Changes in views:

  * Replaced custom transaction context with a simple decorator for managing
    transactions and a context 'ExceptionHandler', which logs and suppresses
    exceptions

* Added fine grain user auth provider's policies.

  * Administrator can override default auth provider policies to a specific 
    user or group of users.
  * Optionally a user can be assigned to a list of groups, based on the
    authentication method he choosed to signup.

* Removed explicit handling of SMTP errors on each email delivery. Exceptions 
  are now propagated to base django exception handler.

* Email used in html/email tempaltes which prompt user to contact for service 
  support prompts is now defined in ``CONTACT_EMAIL`` setting introduced in 
  snf-common settings.

* Improvements in user activation flow

  * User moderation now takes place after the user has verified his email
    address.
  * User model enriched with additional user state fields
  * Split activation email from moderation process. Administrator is required 
    to moderate user explicitly using the `user-modify --accept` or
    `user-modify --reject` commands.
  * Improved logging throught out user activation procedures.

* Remove deprecated AstakosUser model fields: `provider`,
  `third_party_identifier`

* Allow override of authentication provider messages using the following 
  format in setting names: ``ASTAKOS_<PROVIDER_MODULE>_<MSGID>_MSG``

* Cloudbar automatically tries to identify the active service based on window 
  location.

* Removing authentication provider view is now CSRF protected.

* New `API access` view, containing useful information to users on how to 
  access available Synnefo services API's.

* Remove of ASTAKOS_*_EMAIL_SUBJECT settings. All email subjects are now 
  defined in astakos.im.messages module. Overriding default values can be 
  achieved using custom gettext files or using astakos messages settings::
	
	#change of greeting email subject
  	ASTAKOS_GREETING_EMAIL_SUBJECT_MESSAGE = 'Welcome to my cloud'

* Remove ``ASTAKOS_ACTIVATION_REDIRECT_URL`` and ``ASTAKOS_LOGIN_SUCCESS_URL`` 
  from astakos .conf file. Settings are dynamically computed based on 
  ``ASTAKOS_BASE_URL``.

* Management commands:

  * Introduced new commands:
     * authpolicy-{add, list, remove, set, show}
     * group-{add, list}
     * component-{add, list, modify, remove}
     * reconcile-resources-astakos
     * resource-{export-astakos, import, modify}
     * service-{export-astakos, import, show}
