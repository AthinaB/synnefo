======

Pithos is a file storage service, built by GRNET using Django (https://www.djangoproject.com/).
Learn more about Pithos at: http://code.grnet.gr/projects/pithos
Consult LICENSE for licensing information.

Documentation
-------------

All docs are in the docs/source directory. The .rst files are perfectly readable in source form.

To build the documentation you need to have Sphinx (http://sphinx.pocoo.org/) installed.

On a typical debian-based Linux system run:
    apt-get install python-django python-setuptools python-sphinx
    apt-get install python-sqlalchemy python-mysqldb python-psycopg2

Then run:
    python setup.py build_sphinx

The documentation will be built in the docs/build/html directory.

Also run:
    python setup.py build_sphinx -b text

Then find the plain text version of the docs in docs/build/text.

Running the server
------------------

Make sure you have all required packages installed:
    apt-get install python-django python-setuptools python-sphinx
    apt-get install python-sqlalchemy python-mysqldb python-psycopg2

Then run:
    python manage.py syncdb
    python manage.py runserver

This server is useful during development, but should not be used for deployment.
To deploy Pithos using Apache, take a look at the Administrator Guide in docs.

Using the tools
---------------

In the pithos/tools directory you will find the following utilities:

    pithos-sh       Pithos shell
    pithos-sync     Pithos synchronization client
    pithos-fs       Pithos FUSE implementation
    pithos-test     Pithos server tests

Also, the pithos/lib directory contains a python library that can be used
to access Pithos and manage stored objects. All tools use the included lib.

Connection options can be set via environmental variables:

    PITHOS_USER             Login user
    PITHOS_AUTH             Login token
    PITHOS_SERVER           Pithos server (default: plus.pithos.grnet.gr)
    PITHOS_API              Pithos server path (default: v1)
    PITHOS_SYNC_CONTAINER   Container to sync with (default: pithos)
