======

Pithos is a file storage service, built using Django (https://www.djangoproject.com/).
Consult LICENSE for licensing information.

Documentation
-------------

All docs are in the docs/source directory. The .rst files are perfectly readable in source form.

To build the documentation you need to have Sphinx (http://sphinx.pocoo.org/) installed.

On a typical debian-based Linux system run:
    apt-get install python-django python-setuptools python-sphinx
    apt-get install python-sqlalchemy python-psycopg2

Enter the pithos dir, copy settings.py.dist to settings.py.

Then run:
    python setup.py build_sphinx

The documentation will be built in the docs/build/html directory.

Also run:
    python setup.py build_sphinx -b text

Then find the plain text version of the docs in docs/build/text.

Running the server
------------------

Make sure you have all required packages installed:
    apt-get install python-django python-setuptools python-sphinx
    apt-get install python-sqlalchemy python-psycopg2

Enter the pithos dir, copy settings.py.dist to settings.py.

Then run:
    python manage.py syncdb
    python manage.py loaddata im/fixtures/auth_test_data.json (to load sample users)
    python manage.py runserver

This server is useful during development, but should not be used for deployment.
To deploy Pithos using Apache, take a look at the Administrator Guide in docs.
