Documentation
-------------

To build the documentation you need to have Sphinx installed:
http://sphinx.pocoo.org/

Run:
    python setup.py build_sphinx

The documentation will be built in the docs/build/html directory.

Also run:
    python setup.py build_sphinx -b text

Then find the plain text version of the docs in docs/build/text.

Running the server
------------------

Enter the pithos dir and run:
    python manage.py runserver

This server is useful during development, but should not be used for deployment.
